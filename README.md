## Goal
This project aims to create a simulator that evaluates the profitability of space mining missions on various celestial bodies.
The program will simulate step-by-step resource extraction, consider economic factors, and apply polymorphism to model different asteroid types. 
The simulation assumes constant gravity and uses predefined resource prices and mission parameters.
